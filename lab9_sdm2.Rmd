# Lab 9: SDMs: Model fitting, prediction, evaluation

*[RMarkdown version of this Lab](lab9_sdm2.Rmd)*

This lab is a continuation of species distribution models (SDMs) using the R package, `dismo`: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dismo/index.html. The package contains a great vignette and you worked through the first part of it in Lab 8. You should complete Lab 8's portion of the vignette with your species of choice before starting on Lab 9.

For this lab, you will work through Part 2 (Chapters 5-7) of the dismo vignette. You can find the vignette here: https://rspatial.org/raster/sdm/index.html. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Define variable containing url

## Bioclimatic Variables
In Ch. 4 of the vignette, you were introduced to environmental predictors, and specifically bioclimatic variables. The dismo vignette reads in [WorldClim](https://www.worldclim.org/) bioclimatic variables. Worldclim interpolates temperature and precipitation from weather stations to create a modeled representation of these data. Note that you can create bioclimatic variables from any gridded climate data source using the command `biovars`. For example, you could use satellite remote sensing (direct measures instead of interpolated) - [NASA's MODIS land surface temperature](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/) and [NASA's GPM (global precipitation measurement)](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GPM/main/index.html). Or you could use [PRISM](https://prism.oregonstate.edu/) data if you're working in the United States. 

The [19 Bioclimatic Variables](https://www.worldclim.org/data/bioclim.html) are listed below. Metadata for these data can be found [here](https://www.worldclim.org/data/worldclim21.html).

*UNITS: the units for temperature are an order of magnitude larger: °C x 10, and 'mm' is the unit for precipitation.*

BIO1 = Annual Mean Temperature

BIO2 = Mean Diurnal Range (Mean of monthly (max temp - min temp))

BIO3 = Isothermality (BIO2/BIO7) (×100)

BIO4 = Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation ×100)

BIO5 = Max Temperature of Warmest Month

BIO6 = Min Temperature of Coldest Month

BIO7 = Temperature Annual Range (BIO5-BIO6)

BIO8 = Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter

BIO9 = Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter

BIO10 = Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter

BIO11 = Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter

BIO12 = Annual Precipitation

BIO13 = Precipitation of Wettest Month

BIO14 = Precipitation of Driest Month

BIO15 = Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation)

BIO16 = Precipitation of Wettest Quarter

BIO17 = Precipitation of Driest Quarter

BIO18 = Precipitation of Warmest Quarter

BIO19 = Precipitation of Coldest Quarter


## What to hand in for Lab 9:
Work through Part 2 (Ch. 5-7) of the vignette with the example dataset. Choose a different species than the one provided in the vignette (different than the *Bradypus* species; it would be easiest to select the species you chose in Lab 8 since you already completed that section). *Note that the extraction of the environmental predictors occurs in Chapter 4 of the vignette, so if you choose a different species than you used in Lab 8, you will need to go back to earlier portions of the vignette.* Re-create Ch. 5-7 of the vignette with your species of interest, constraining the region of your study area to your species known range (ensure that you remove outliers from zoos, incorrect locations by looking up the known range from an independent source). 

For more background information on **AUC and Spatial Sorting Bias**, see the additional text below the QUESTIONS.

*NOTE 1:* To obtain WorldClim data outside the dismo package area (Central & South America), go to the WorldClim website to see the data options: https://worldclim.org/data/worldclim21.html. Then you will need to read in the data like this:

```{r}
# Download 10minute res worldclim V 2.1
wc_url_10m<- "https://geodata.ucdavis.edu/climate/worldclim/2_1/base/wc2.1_10m_bio.zip"
# Download 5minute res worldclim V 2.1
#wc_url_5m<- "https://geodata.ucdavis.edu/climate/worldclim/2_1/base/wc2.1_10m_bio.zip"
# Download 2.5minute res worldclim V 2.1
#wc_url_2.5m<- "https://geodata.ucdavis.edu/climate/worldclim/2_1/base/wc2.1_10m_bio.zip"
# Download 30second res worldclim V 2.1
#wc_url_30s<- "https://geodata.ucdavis.edu/climate/worldclim/2_1/base/wc2.1_10m_bio.zip"
download.file(wc_url_10m, destfile="wc2.1_10m_bio.zip")
unzip("wc2.1_10m_bio.zip")

plot(wc2.1_10m_bio)

# Older versions of
library(raster)
# Use the getData command
?getData
# World-wide, all bioclim variables, 10 minutes of a degree resolution
w_data_world<-getData('worldclim', var='bio', res=10)
plot(w_data_world)
# Region-specific (lon and lat are centered on the area); 0.5 minutes of a degree resolution
w_data_europe<-getData('worldclim', var='bio', res=0.5, lon=5, lat=45)
plot(w_data_europe)
```

*NOTE 2:* In Ch. 5-7 of the vignette, when creating the reduced model with a subset of bioclimatic variables (e.g., bio1, bio5, bio12), you can choose to select different bioclimatic variables - see the list of bioclimatic variables above. You should choose a different subset only if the results of your full model (containing the fuller set of bioclimatic variables) suggest a different set, or if you have *a priori* knowledge of the species-climate relationship.

Show your work (code and output) for this portion of the vignette (Chapters 5-7). You can either add on to Lab 8's .Rmd file of the vignette that you already produced to create a longer PDF or HTML, or you can hand in a new PDF or HTML with just Lab 9's section included. Either way, please hand in a PDF or HTML produced from your .Rmd file to show all your work for Ch. 5-7.

After completing the vignette with your species of choice, answer the following QUESTIONS:

### QUESTION 1: 
Describe the differences you observe in the mapped prediction between the full model, and the reduced model. Which mapped prediction is closer to the known distribution of the species? Provide a source and image (e.g., screenshot) of an independent source showing the range map of the species. 

### QUESTION 2:
Which model, the full or reduced model, performs better? Why? Include plots and model statistics to help with your explanation.


**Extra information on AUC and Spatial Sorting Bias (SSB):**
In general AUC improves with larger geographic extents. As with most of these metrics, you should only compare them across models that have the same input data (meaning the same records for occurrences; same number of rows of unique presence and absence locations). Splitting data into training and testing makes the model susceptible to being influenced by the actual distances between the testing and training data in space. To remove this bias, you can subset the data into training and testing with pairwise distance sampling (`pwdSample` in `dismo` package).

Type the following to see the full details on the `pwdSample` command: 

```{r}
library(dismo)
?pwdSample
```
